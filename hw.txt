Files from last nights class have been uploaded to dropbox (SL Class 76).

For homework:

Use Mongoose to do the following:

Note make sure to look at the Mongoose docs, they are useful. Also start with
 just doing employee with a simple string for department. Once you have employees
  working properly move on to the department part of the exercise if you have time.

Create a schema for an employee. Employees will have:
name (you can do name sub document with first and last and even a virtual full
 like we did in class for contact if you like - or just be lazy and have a single
  name property. Whatever you feel like doing)
salary
department - where department is ref to a department object (see below)
Create a schema for a department. Department will have:
name
array of employees where employees are refs to employee objects (see above)
Add print method to both schemas to print the objects out (where departments call 
print on each employee to print them). Maybe something like:
Sales
- Joe Smith: 50000
- Donald Trump: 120000

Engineering
- Bernie Sanders

Create the models for each of the schemas.

Create a few departments and employees. Stick the employees in various departments
. Save the employees. Save the departments

Reload the departments - make sure to populate the employees in each department.
 Print out the departments. Verify that you see the departments and the employees
  printed out as expected. NOTE: I purposely am not printing the department name 
  when printing each employee. If you did want to print that you will need to 
  populate the department inside the employees as well (not just the employees
   in the departments). You can try playing with getting that working if you have time.

Keep in mind that all interactions with mongo are asynchronous!
